        People and Songs is a community of singers who want to increase their knowledge in music and ministry. A school was formed in Indiana to help equip students to become better worship leaders, songwriters, musicians and missionaries. Singers change, but their energy continues to grow. Check them out on tours or near neighboring churches helping communities grow.</p>
